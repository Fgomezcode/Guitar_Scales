Download files into a folder. Keep main.exe and text files in the same folder.

This program works by pulling the information stored on 'Progressions.txt', 'Scale_Names.txt', and 'Scale_Steps.txt'

These files come preloaded with scales, names and progressions but more can be added

NAMES and SCALES - 
When adding information to these files make sure they do not end with a blank line, do not press enter after the last entry.
Scales_Name.txt and Scale_Steps.txt must be the same length, if you do not have complete information it is best to leave the files alone.

Progressions.txt can be any length as it not dependent on other files. 

Progressions must follow the following spacing convention 'I – I – i – iii' no spaces to start or end progressions.
Hyphens are proceeded and followed by a space ex. ' - ' do not include quotes.

Standard notation dictates that capital roman numerals are Major, lower case roman numerals are Minor, and 'dim' can be included if the scale is uncommon.

STEPS - 
This files follows similar spacing convention. No spaces proceeding or following the steps, each character separated by on space. 
'H H W WH H H'
Each character has a numeric value, H= 1, W= 2, WH= 3 ( H = half-step, W = whole-step, WH = 'step and a half' ( three steps)

There are 41 scales and 21 chord progressions included with this program. Please use freely but not for profit
